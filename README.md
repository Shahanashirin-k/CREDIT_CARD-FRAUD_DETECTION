# CREDIT_CARD-FRAUD_DETECTION
## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to employ machine learning techniques to identify fraudulent credit card transactions. The objective is to examine several model architectures, including advanced models, supervised learning algorithms, and anomaly detection, in order to ascertain which, one is most effective at detecting fraudulent transactions. To increase model accuracy, the project entails analysing a credit card transaction dataset from Kaggle and using a variety of feature engineering and anomaly detection techniques.
